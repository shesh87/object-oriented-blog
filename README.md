Basic blog
This is very simple. Implement a Blog class where you can add Post objects. Each post will have a title, a date and a text. Then add a front_page method at Blog that returns the front page of the blog in the following format:

Post title 1
**************
Post 1 text
----------------
Post title 2
**************
Post 2 text
----------------
Post title 3
**************
Post 3 text
----------------

The post should be ordered by date starting on newest.
